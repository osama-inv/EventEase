# introdution

This is where EventEase comes in - a comprehensive event planning app designed to simplify the process and make event organization a breeze.

The app starts by guiding the user through a series of questions to understand the type of event, the number of guests, the desired location, and the overall budget. Based on this information, EventEase generates a customized timeline and to-do list, breaking down the planning process into manageable tasks.
